The image shows a comparison between the correct and incorrect ways of performing the Lunge Pose, also known as Anjneyasasana. On the left side, the correct way to do the pose is shown, with the following characteristics:
- The front knee is bent at about a 90-degree angle.
- The back leg is stretched out straight with the heel touching the ground.
- The torso is upright, and arms are raised or stretched above the head.
- The hips are aligned, and the torso is leaning slightly forward.
- The shoulders are over the wrists, with the arms extended upwards.
- The back knee is touching the ground without any bending.
- Not all texts match perfectly, but there is an emphasis on the correct posture details in these example.

On the right side, the incorrect way to perform the pose is illustrated:
 - The front knee extends past the toes and does not maintain a 90-degree bend.
 - The torso leans tooled or forward, disrupting the alignment.
 - The back leg may not maintain an extended straight position, and the heel could be lifted off the ground.
 - The shoulders may not be in line with the wrists, suggesting a misalignment in the arm position.

Given the detailed posture indicators, the Lunge Pose stands out clearly as the correct pose depicted on the left side.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bound Angle Pose (Ardha Baddhaa Padmasana)

---

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Body Position**:** The individual has the legs extended back in a wide stance, with hands reaching down to grasp the feet. This wide seated position and the reaching forward suggest the possibility of a forward bend or bound pose.
   
2. **Hip Positioning**:** The legs are spread wide, which is characteristic of a Bound Angle Pose or a variation of a forward bend to maintain support.

3. **Torso and Arm Position**:** The torso leans forward while grasping the feet, which aligns with the nature of a forward fold. However, the holding of the feet with extended legs hints at preparation for the deep forward bend that is typically observed in the Bound Angle Pose.

4. **Alignment and Focus:** The individual’s head turned slightly upward while maintaining a balanced posture is consistent with preparatory poses in forward binding sequences.

Based on these observations, Bound Angle Pose fits as the most appropriate prediction among the provided yoga poses due to the leg and hand positioning, and forward leaned torso.",52,Seated Forward Bend,3,Bound Angle Pose,3,Bound Angle Pose,3,Bound Angle Pose,3,Bound Angle Pose
