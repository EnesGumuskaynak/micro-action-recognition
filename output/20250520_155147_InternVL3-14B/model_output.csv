Reviewing the options, none exactly match the squatting pose with heels on the ground and wide-knee placement.

Yet another fitting name, given the constraints, might be **Garland Pose (Mala Asana)**, which incorporates a squatting position.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Most closely resembles **Garland Pose (Mala Asana)** or re-interpreting the closest accurate options, though none are a perfect fit.
