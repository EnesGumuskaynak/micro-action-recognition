Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: Based on the body position where the person has an upright torso but leans backward slightly, supporting themselves through engaged core muscles and balancing on the thighs (though not visible in this image), it closely resembles the ""Boat Pose"" or ""Navasana."" However, since there's no indication of the legs being raised off the ground as typically seen in Navasana, another suitable option might be ""Seated Forward Bend,"" also known as ""Paschimottanasana.""

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: Based on the description of the pose, where one's legs are lifted off the ground and held straight out to the side (though not entirely clear if they're fully vertical), and the torso remains upright or leans backward slightly as part of maintaining balance, this closely matches the characteristics of the ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana) from traditional yoga practices.

- The person's back is raised.
- One leg is bent at the knee while both arms reach towards it (though not clearly visible if they're reaching or just grasping).
- This pose requires balance, strength, and focus to maintain stability without falling over due to gravity pulling down from above (head) versus upward force exerted by the lower body pushing up against resistance.

The closest match among the listed yoga poses that describes this position would be ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana). In Navasana, one typically sits upright with knees bent and toes touching the ground, then leans backward into a reclined position using arm strength to lift the upper body away from the thighs until forming an angle reminiscent of sitting half-on a boat hull.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Explanation: Based on the description of the pose, where the person's back is arched forward and they are balancing on their knees and palms, it closely resembles ""Ustrasana"" or Camel Pose (in Sanskrit).

Their torso is bent forward, and they are leaning over towards the ground between two large windows. They appear to be stretching or performing a gentle yoga pose that involves flexibility.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Extended Puppy Pose

Explanation: Based on the description of the body position—kneeling, upper body bent forward, supported by arms—the most appropriate match from the list provided would likely be ""Extended Puppy Pose."" This pose typically involves being on all fours (in this case, possibly more relaxed due to lying down), with an extended spine as one leans back slightly while maintaining support through the forearms. It's similar but less intense than some other poses listed like ""Cobra Pose"" which usually has more lift for the chest area.",7,Cat Cow Pose,20,Extended Puppy Pose

Explanation: Based on the description provided, this yoga pose closely resembles ""Camel Pose"" (Ustrasana). In Camel Pose, practitioners typically kneel or sit cross-legged with their hips raised slightly off the floor. They then lean backward from the hip crease into a deep arching motion that opens up the chest and throat area. The similarities between the described image and typical instructions for Camel Pose indicate that it is indeed the most appropriate match among the listed classes.",7,Cat Cow Pose,6,Camel Pose
Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/2_116.jpg,"Description: The image shows two yoga poses side by side. On the left, a person is in a pose that resembles Downward-Facing Dog with their hands and feet on the mat, hips raised high, and body forming an inverted 'V' shape. This posture involves bending at the waist while keeping both arms straight to support the weight of the upper body.

On the right, another individual appears to be transitioning into or out of a backbend position known as Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana). They are lying face down with palms flat on the ground, lifting the chest off the floor using the strength of the back muscles.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Extended Cobra Pose

Explanation for prediction:
The pose on the right closely matches the description of Cobra Pose but seems extended due to the increased arch in the spine compared to a standard Cobra Pose. Therefore, it's likely the ""Extended Cobra Pose"" from the provided list of classes.",7,Cat Cow Pose,20,Extended Puppy Pose
Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/2_595.jpg,"Description: The individual is in a kneeling position with their hands placed firmly on the ground, shoulders directly over wrists.

Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/1_76.jpg,"Description: The image shows a person in an unusual and contorted yoga pose. They are on their hands and knees, with the back arched significantly upward to form a deep backward curve. Their head is extended forward, almost parallel to the ground but slightly lower due to the arch of the spine. This posture creates a long line from the feet through the hips, torso, neck, and down to the face.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Justification:
- The description matches closely with the ""Cobra Pose"" (Bhujangasana) as it involves extending the upper body while remaining grounded.
- While traditional Cobra Pose has more flexibility in arm placement and does not involve such extreme curvature or extension of the legs, this variation could be interpreted as an advanced version where additional limbs or parts of the body extend into space for balance or artistic effect.
- None of the other poses listed have this specific combination of elements described; thus, Cobra Pose remains the most fitting choice based on available options.",7,Cat Cow Pose,10,Cobra Pose
Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/2_407.jpg,"Description: The image shows a person performing two different yoga poses on a black mat in what appears to be an indoor setting with wooden flooring and glass doors. In the left pose, the individual is bent over at the waist with their hands placed firmly on the mat, supporting their upper body weight. Their head is tucked down towards their thighs, indicating a forward bend stretch.

In the right pose, the same individual maintains a similar hand position but has lifted their hips off the ground, creating an arch in their back while keeping their legs straight behind them. This posture suggests engagement of core muscles for support during the lift.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

The sequence from bending over into lifting the torso resembles transitions often seen in cobra-like stretches or poses that focus on opening the chest and engaging the spine. Given these characteristics, ""Cobra Pose"" (Bhujangasana) seems most appropriate as it involves lying face down and then lifting the chest by extending the arms away from the body, which aligns closely with both depicted positions.",7,Cat Cow Pose,10,Cobra Pose
Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/2_135.jpg,"Description: The individual in the image is performing a yoga pose that involves kneeling on the ground with their hands placed firmly on the mat, supporting their upper body. Their hips are raised off the ground while maintaining contact only at the knees and feet. This position creates an arch or bridge-like shape from the thighs to the shoulders. The person's gaze appears to be directed upwards towards the ceiling.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bridge Pose

Explanation: Based on the described posture—kneeling with hip elevation supported by hand placement—the most appropriate match from the provided list of 82 classes is ""Bridge Pose."" In this traditional yoga pose, practitioners lift the pelvis upward using their arms for support, creating a curved line from head to heels, which closely matches the description given.",7,Cat Cow Pose,5,Bridge Pose

Their right hand supports them from behind, while their left arm extends forward and touches the ground for balance. This posture resembles an inverted bridge or a deep backbend variation.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Explanation: Given the description of the pose—kneeling position with a pronounced backward curve—it closely matches the characteristics of ""Camel Pose"" (Ustrasana) found in traditional yoga practices. However, due to the unique positioning where the hands are placed—one supporting from behind—the specific name might not be entirely accurate but it still aligns most closely with this list among other poses described.",7,Cat Cow Pose,6,Camel Pose
Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/1_542.jpg,"Description: The image depicts a person in a yoga pose with their left knee on the ground and both hands planted firmly, supporting their body.

- One knee bent and resting on the ground.
- Both arms are reaching down towards or alongside the feet for balance.
- The back foot is flat on the floor, creating stability.
- The chest is lifted upwards as much as possible without straining the lower back.
- The head is aligned over the spine, looking slightly upward to maintain focus and proper alignment.

This description matches closely with the ""Low Lunge Pose"" from the list provided, which also emphasizes one knee on the ground, supported by two hands, and maintaining a stable stance through the extension of the other leg and arm placement.",7,Cat Cow Pose,40,Low Lunge Pose
Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/2_276.jpg,"Description: The individual in the image is performing a yoga pose that involves bending forward from an all-fours position. Their arms are straight, with palms flat on the ground and fingers spread out for stability. They have their legs extended backward, toes pointed, which suggests they may be attempting to balance or deepen into this stretch. This posture resembles a combination of poses commonly found in various sequences.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Explanation: Based on the body orientation—bent at the waist with hips lifted—and the arm positioning supporting weight while maintaining contact with the floor, it closely matches the characteristics of ""Camel Pose"" (Ustrasana). In this pose, practitioners typically extend their upper back slightly and gaze over their shoulders towards the feet, although here we see more focus on hip extension rather than full back arching.",7,Cat Cow Pose,6,Camel Pose
Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/1_399.jpg,"Description: The image shows a person performing a yoga pose on their knees and toes. They are bending backward at the hips, with their back arched prominently. Their hands are placed flat on the mat in front of them for support. Key instructions labeled around the body indicate specific actions to maintain proper form:

- ""Tailbone down"" is indicated by an arrow pointing towards the tailbone.
- ""Pull abs back toward spine"" suggests engaging the abdominal muscles.
- ""Engage buttocks"" points out the gluteal region.

The posture involves significant spinal extension, indicating core strength and flexibility.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Explanation: Based on the description provided, the individual appears to be executing a variation of the Camel Pose (Ustrasana). This pose typically features a deep forward bend from all fours position, with emphasis on arching the lower back while keeping the chest open and looking up or over one's head. However, this particular execution seems more focused on maintaining stability through engagement of the core and buttocks, which aligns closely with certain variations or preparatory stages often seen in Camel Pose sequences.",7,Cat Cow Pose,6,Camel Pose
Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/2_94.jpg,"Description: The individual is in a yoga pose known as the Cobra Pose, also referred to by its Sanskrit name Bhujangasana.

Their back is arched upwards and they are looking forward or up towards the sky. This pose involves engaging core muscles to maintain an upright posture while balancing on all fours.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Justification:
- The arching of the spine matches the characteristic curve seen in Camel Pose.
- The hand placement and leg positioning align well with this yoga pose's form.
- The overall body orientation suggests a variation that focuses more on stretching the front torso rather than deep backbending as typically performed in traditional Camel Pose.",7,Cat Cow Pose,6,Camel Pose
Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/1_92.jpg,"Description: The individual in the image is performing a yoga pose that involves kneeling on the ground with their hands and knees touching. Their torso is bent forward, creating an arch shape between their thighs and arms. This posture resembles a combination of the Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana) and possibly the Bow Pose (Dhanurasana), as it emphasizes opening up through the chest while maintaining support from the forearms.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Explanation: Based on the description provided, the most appropriate match from the given list appears to be ""Cobra Pose"" due to the prominent arching action seen here which targets the spine's flexibility and strength. It also shares similarities with Dhanurasana but without lifting the legs off the ground, making it more suitable for this particular depiction.",7,Cat Cow Pose,10,Cobra Pose
Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/2_388.jpg,"Description: The individual is in a kneeling position with their hands placed firmly on the ground, elbows bent at approximately 90 degrees. Their body forms an inverted 'V' shape as they lean backward from their hips while keeping one leg straight and the other knee grounded. This pose emphasizes flexibility and strength.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/1_391.jpg,"Description: The individual is positioned on a bed in what appears to be a yoga pose. They are kneeling with their hands supporting them from behind, while one leg is bent and the other extended backward. This position resembles a variation of the ""Upward Bow"" or ""Wheel"" Pose (Urdhva Dhanurasana) but adapted for a softer surface like a bed.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Upward Bow (Wheel) Pose

Explanation: Given that this person is not standing but rather supported by a soft surface such as a bed, it's an adaptation of the traditional Upward Bow Pose. The key features align closely with those found in Urdhva Dhanurasana—knees on the ground, chest lifted, arms reaching back—but modified due to the lack of floor support.",7,Cat Cow Pose,69,Upward Bow (Wheel) Pose

Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/2_32.jpg,"Description: The individual is in a kneeling position with their hands placed on the ground, slightly behind and to the sides of their shoulders. Their back is arched upwards, creating an S-shape curvature from head to tailbone. This pose resembles a bridge or camel-like posture but lacks full body contact with the mat as seen in traditional Camel Pose (Ustrasana). It appears more like a preparatory stance for advanced yoga poses.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bridge Pose

Explanation: Based on the description, this pose closely aligns with what is commonly known as ""Bridge Pose"" or Setu Bandhasana in Sanskrit. In this pose, one typically lies flat on their back with knees bent upward toward the chest while lifting the hips off the floor. However, given that the person's feet are not touching the ground and they're in a kneeling rather than lying down position, it deviates significantly from the classic Bridge Pose. Therefore, considering these differences, ""Bridge Pose"" remains the most appropriate match among the provided options despite its slight variation.",7,Cat Cow Pose,5,Bridge Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Explanation: Based on the body position described—kneeling stance with an upward arch of the spine—the pose closely resembles the Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana) from yoga classes. In this classic yoga pose, practitioners lie face down with arms extended along the sides of the torso before lifting the upper body to create a smooth curve or wave-like motion through the spine. Although the image shows only one side view, the distinctive features such as the raised hips and engaged core are indicative of the Cobra Pose's essence.",7,Cat Cow Pose,10,Cobra Pose
Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/2_21.jpg,"Description: The individual is in a yoga pose on the beach, facing away from the camera with their body parallel to the water.

In the first pose, the individual is in all fours with their hands and knees on the mat, facing sideways while looking over their shoulder towards the camera. Their back is slightly arched upwards, creating an S-shape with their body.

In the second pose, the same person transitions into a forward bend from the all-fours position. They lower their torso closer to the mat by bending at the hips and extending their arms downwards so that they touch the ground behind them. This creates a more pronounced arch in their spine compared to the first pose.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Extended Puppy Pose

The sequence of poses closely resembles ""Extended Puppy Pose"" (Uttana Shishosana), which involves transitioning between similar positions focusing on spinal flexibility and relaxation.",7,Cat Cow Pose,20,Extended Puppy Pose

In ""fig 2: Exhale,"" the same individual transitions into a forward bend from the tabletop position. Their torso arches downward towards the floor while maintaining contact at the fingertips, which are extended behind them to deepen the stretch. This posture closely aligns with a backbend variation of a seated forward bend (Paschimottanasana) or possibly a deep backbend transition before moving into a more advanced inversion like a shoulder stand or crow pose.

- Lying face down (Bhujangasana or Cobra Pose).
- Arched back supported by arm strength.
- Head raised but not fully upright as it would be in Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana).

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Justification:
- The person's arms are positioned under the shoulders, which aligns well with the starting posture of the Cobra Pose.
- This pose typically involves lifting the chest off the ground while keeping the elbows close to the sides, though this specific image shows more of a restful state rather than active engagement as seen in the actual Cobra Pose.
- Given that there is no indication of movement towards a full stretch like one would see during the execution of Cobra Pose, it seems most likely that the subject is either beginning to transition into this pose or has just completed it, leading them into a momentary pause before continuing.",10,Cobra Pose,10,Cobra Pose

They are supporting themselves on forearms and feet, creating an arch from the lower back upwards towards the hips. This pose involves engaging the core muscles while maintaining balance through arm strength.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Justification:
- The posture shows engagement of the upper body.
- The arms are straight and positioned under the shoulders for support.
- There's no indication of leg elevation or backward bending that would suggest poses like Bow Pose (Marichyasana C) or Plow Pose (Halasana).
- It does not have the forward fold characteristic of Forward Bend Poses such as Standing Forward Bend (Uttanasana) or Seated Forward Bend (Paschimottanasana). 
- The alignment suggests it’s more about opening the chest rather than stretching the legs apart which eliminates poses like Wide-Legged Forward Bend (Prasarita Padottanasana).

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Justification for Prediction:
- The posture closely resembles the Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana), which typically features an arched back supported by arm strength.
- Although this version lacks the full arch seen in traditional Cobra Pose due to the person's head being turned sideways, it still maintains key elements such as the extension of the spine and support from the forearms.
- Other poses listed do not match as precisely because they either involve different limb positions or additional twists that aren't present here.",10,Cobra Pose,10,Cobra Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Seated Forward Bend

Explanation:
- **Seated Forward Bend (Paschimottanasana)** is characterized by sitting on one's heels or toes, bending forward at the hips while keeping the legs straight.
- This pose aligns well with the posture observed in the image where participants have their legs extended backward and are leaning forward from the hips.
- The head tilting upward could indicate an extension of this traditional pose into a variation focused more on opening the chest and shoulders rather than deepening the bend over the thighs as typically seen in Paschimottanasana.

In Cobra Pose, the body's lower half remains stationary while the upper body lifts off the ground to stretch the front of the body.

Explanation: Based on the description provided:
- The body position shows the chest open and elevated.
- The back is arched backward.
- The hands are placed flat on the mat or surface below.
- The feet are pointed away from each other slightly apart.
These characteristics match the traditional posture of ""Ustrasana"" or Camel Pose (in Sanskrit), which involves arching the back while supporting oneself on the forearms and lifting the chest upward.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Justification:
- **Arched Back**: Both poses involve an arching or lifting action of the spine.
- **Supporting Hand**: In both cases, there is support provided by placing hands on the ground while maintaining balance.
- **Leg Position**: The legs being extended straight back aligns more closely with the description of Cobra Pose rather than other mentioned yoga poses which often have different leg positions such as bending knees or crossing legs.

Therefore, based on these observations, ""Cobra Pose"" seems to be the most appropriate match among the given options.",10,Cobra Pose,10,Cobra Pose
Cobra_Pose_or_Bhujangasana_/1_326.jpg,"Description: The image shows three individuals in a yoga studio. Two women and one man are performing different poses on their mats.

- The woman standing is assisting another woman who is lying prone with her arms extended forward, legs straight behind her, and head lifted slightly off the mat.
- The second woman appears to be practicing a pose that involves strength and flexibility of the back muscles, likely an advanced posture given the assistance provided by the instructor.
- The third individual, a man, is also lying prone but has his hands placed under his hips for support, which suggests he might be doing a variation of a plank or bridge pose designed to strengthen the core and lower body.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bridge Pose

Explanation: Based on the description:
- The person being assisted seems to have a position similar to ""Reclining Cobra"" due to the backward curve of the spine while supported at the feet, indicating significant upper back extension.
- However, considering the additional detail about the assistant's hand placement supporting near the shoulders (commonly seen during variations like Reclining Camel), it aligns more closely with the characteristics described as part of a modified version of the traditional Bridge Pose known for strengthening the glutes and hamstrings while improving spinal mobility.

Given these observations, ""Bridge Pose"" from the list best fits this scenario because it often includes elements where participants lift their hips towards the ceiling, sometimes requiring external support if they're not fully capable of maintaining balance independently without compromising form.",10,Cobra Pose,5,Bridge Pose
Cobra_Pose_or_Bhujangasana_/3_656.jpg,"Description: The individual is in a pose that resembles the ""Camel Pose"" (Ustrasana) with modifications. They are standing on their mat, facing forward but leaning back significantly from an upright position.

They are lying prone on their stomach with arms extended forward, supporting their upper body and chest off the ground. Their legs remain straight behind them, and they appear to be looking slightly upwards.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

This prediction aligns with the description as the person's posture involves lifting the torso while keeping the feet flat on the ground, which is characteristic of the Cobra Pose.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Justification:
- The individual's back is arched significantly.
- One hand is supporting the lower part of the body (chest or abdomen).
- The legs are straight and raised towards the sky, which aligns with characteristics of Camel Pose.
- This position resembles the classic Camel Pose more than any other listed options due to the pronounced backbend and hip lift.",10,Cobra Pose,6,Camel Pose

This position resembles a combination of poses such as the ""Dolphin Pose"" or an advanced variation where the body forms a straight line from head to heels.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Dolphin Plank Pose

The person's posture, with arms and legs aligned parallel to each other and forming a straight line through the torso, suggests they are performing a more complex version of the standard plank pose. The term ""Dolphin Plank Pose"" accurately describes this specific alignment while indicating its connection to traditional planking exercises.",10,Cobra Pose,15,Dolphin Plank Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bow Pose

Justification:
The bow pose (Dhanurasana) typically features an arching of the back while lying flat on the stomach, but in this image, the person's body position suggests they are standing rather than lying down. This adaptation could be interpreted as a variation where the practitioner attempts to mimic the curvature of the spine seen in Dhanurasana by using a deep backward bend while maintaining balance on all fours. Therefore, ""Bow Pose"" seems most appropriate despite not being exactly identical due to the standing nature of the pose in the image provided.",11,Cockerel Pose,4,Bow Pose
Cockerel_Pose/4_248.jpg,"Description: The person in the image is performing a backbend yoga pose. They are bending backward with their torso and head touching or nearly touching the floor, while one leg is extended straight up against the wall for support. This position requires significant flexibility and strength.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

This description matches closely with ""Camel Pose"" (Ustrasana), which involves arching the back deeply to bring the chest forward towards the thighs, often supported by holding onto hands placed on the heels of standing legs. In this case, due to the extension of one leg against the wall, it could also be described as an advanced variation where external support helps maintain balance during the deep backbend.",11,Cockerel Pose,6,Camel Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Low Lunge Pose

Explanation: Based on the body position where the individual is bent at the hips and thighs, touching the ground between their legs, it closely resembles the ""Low Lunge"" (Anjaneyasana) pose commonly found in various yoga classes.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Eagle Pose

Explanation:
The described position closely matches ""Eagle Pose"" (Garudasana), which typically features an inverted V shape where one's body forms an arch from head to feet while maintaining hand support for stability.

In this pose, the practitioner stands firmly on one foot (usually the right) while bending the left knee to bring it close to the standing ankle or shin. They then lift their torso sideways towards the extended arm, creating an angle of approximately 90 degrees between both legs. Their gaze follows the upward-facing hand, enhancing focus and stability throughout the movement.",21,Extended Side Angle Pose,20,Extended Puppy Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Extended Side Angle Pose

Explanation:
- The individual has their left hand placed firmly on the ground.
- Their right arm extends straight out to the front with the elbow aligned above the wrist.
- They are lifting their hips off the mat, creating a diagonal line from head to feet through the body.
- There's emphasis on rotating the inner thigh upward for stability and balance.
- An alternative instruction suggests placing the forearm on top of the right thigh if full reach isn't possible without compromising form.

They are positioned in a dynamic posture that involves one leg bent at the knee while the other leg extends backward, parallel to the ground. Their torso leans forward, creating a diagonal line from their raised hand down through their body to their extended foot.

The arms play a significant role in this pose; one arm reaches upward towards the sun, adding height and grace to the stance, while the opposite arm supports the weight by placing it firmly on the hip. This combination creates a sense of balance and strength within the pose. The head is likely tilted slightly downward due to the forward lean of the torso.

This posture requires significant core strength, balance, and flexibility. The body forms an inverted 'V' shape with the legs spread wide apart.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cockerel Pose

The pose closely resembles what is commonly known as ""Cockerel Pose"" or ""Ushkasana,"" which is characterized by standing on two fingers (hands) and having one leg extended back behind the head. However, due to the slight variation where only one hand seems to be supporting the weight instead of two, it may not strictly fit into traditional categorizations but still shares similarities with poses like Crane Pose or One-Legged Crow Pose.",24,Firefly Pose,11,Cockerel Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: One-Legged Downward-Facing Dog

The pose described closely matches ""One-Legged Downward-Facing Dog,"" which is an advanced variation of the traditional Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana). In this version, instead of both legs being flat on the ground as in the standard pose, only one leg remains straight while the other is lifted off the ground to create a diagonal line from hand to foot. This challenging posture emphasizes core stability, arm strength, and hip flexibility.",24,Firefly Pose,Bilinmiyor,Bilinmiyor
Firefly_Pose_or_Tittibhasana_/72.jpg,"Description: The individual is in a yoga pose that involves bending forward at the hips, with one leg extended behind and the other bent. The arms are stretched out to touch the floor or toes of the back foot, creating an arc-like shape from head to heels. This posture resembles a combination of flexibility and balance.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Intense Side Stretch Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bow Pose

Justification:
The pose described shows significant flexibility in the spine and arms while maintaining balance, which aligns closely with the characteristics of ""Bow Pose"" (Dhanurasana). In this classic asana, practitioners often bend their knees to lift their torso towards the sky, resembling bowing down like an arrow being drawn back by a string. However, given the specific details about the hand position and orientation mentioned, it's more indicative of a variation where only one side of the body is engaged rather than fully symmetrical lifting. Thus, considering these nuances, ""Bow Pose"" remains the most appropriate match from the provided list.",24,Firefly Pose,4,Bow Pose

Their other leg is bent at the knee with the sole of the foot pressed against the inner thigh or hip area. This pose requires significant core strength, balance, and flexibility.

Predicted Yoga Pose: One-Legged Downward-Facing Dog

This prediction aligns with the description because:
- It resembles a variation of ""Downward-Facing Dog"" where only one leg (instead of both) is lifted.
- The posture's complexity matches the level of difficulty often associated with advanced poses listed under various classes.
- There is no mention of any specific name for this particular pose in common yoga terminology, so it may be considered as a unique expression within the context of more complex variations of standard poses like Downward-Facing Dog.",24,Firefly Pose,Bilinmiyor,Bilinmiyor

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose (Navasana)

Explanation: While this pose does not exactly match any classical yoga posture due to being performed outside its traditional context, it resembles elements commonly associated with Navasana or ""Boat Pose.""

Predicted Yoga Pose: Reclining Cobbler Pose

Explanation: Based on the description of the pose in the image, it closely resembles the ""Reclining Cobbler Pose"" (Supta Baddha Konasana) commonly practiced in yoga routines. This pose typically involves extending both legs out to the sides while keeping them together at the knees, which matches the position seen in the image where the person's legs appear to be spread apart but still close together due to the angle of the photograph.",25,Fish Pose,48,Reclining Hand-to-Big-Toe Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Justification:
- The pose involves lifting the upper body from a prone position.
- The forearms rest near or under the chest, which matches the description provided for Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana).
- The hips remain grounded as the back lifts upwards, consistent with this yoga posture.",25,Fish Pose,10,Cobra Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Explanation: This pose matches the description of ""Cobra Pose"" (Bhujangasana) as it involves extending the chest forward while supporting the body weight primarily through the forearms placed firmly on the ground. The lifted torso resembles that of a cobra snake, hence the name. It's important to note that this identification assumes standard yoga terminology based on common practice descriptions.",25,Fish Pose,10,Cobra Pose
Fish_Pose_or_Matsyasana_/325.jpg,"Description: The individual is lying on their stomach with legs extended straight out and arms reaching forward, palms touching the ground. Their body forms a horizontal line parallel to the horizon.

Fish_Pose_or_Matsyasana_/189.jpg,"Description: The individual is lying on their stomach with legs extended straight behind them. They are lifting the upper body off the ground, supported by the forearms and elbows in a plank-like position. This pose combines elements of both Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana) and Plank Pose (Phalakasana), creating a hybrid posture that strengthens the arms, back, and core muscles.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Explanation: The combination of supporting weight through the forearms while arching the spine closely matches the description of Cobra Pose, which involves lifting the chest and head from the floor to stretch the front body and open up the shoulders. While there is also a plank element present, it does not dominate enough to classify this as purely a Plank Pose. Therefore, Cobra Pose seems to be the most appropriate name for this pose based on its distinctive features.",25,Fish Pose,10,Cobra Pose
Fish_Pose_or_Matsyasana_/97.jpg,"Description: The individual is performing a yoga pose with their body bent backward. They are lying on their back, knees drawn up towards the chest, and arms wrapped around the legs or holding onto them near the thighs. This posture appears to be a variation of a deep backbend.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bow Pose (Dhanurasana) - Variation

Justification:
- The person's position involves significant spinal flexion.
- The hands are placed under the hips, which suggests they might be using an aid for support during this intense backbend.
- While it closely resembles Dhanurasana (Bow Pose), the use of aids makes it more specific as a variation that could assist in achieving deeper flexibility while maintaining safety.",25,Fish Pose,4,Bow Pose
Fish_Pose_or_Matsyasana_/454.jpg,"Description: The individual is in a prone position with their legs extended straight back and feet together.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bow Pose

This posture appears to be a variation of the Bridge Pose or Setu Bandha Sarvangasana, which targets the glutes, hamstrings, and lower back while also stretching the chest and shoulders.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bridge Pose

Explanation: Based on the description provided, the most appropriate name from the list for this pose would likely be ""Bridge Pose."" This is because it shares key characteristics such as lifting the hips towards the ceiling, bending at the waist, and extending the arms overhead. While there are variations in execution, the fundamental elements align closely with what is typically known as the Bridge Pose in various yoga practices.",25,Fish Pose,5,Bridge Pose
Fish_Pose_or_Matsyasana_/331.jpg,"Description: The individual is in a yoga pose that resembles the Camel Pose (Ustrasana). They are lying on their stomach with a bolster under their hips, which supports them to arch their back upwards.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose",25,Fish Pose,6,Camel Pose
Fish_Pose_or_Matsyasana_/413.jpg,"Description: The person lying on the mat is in a supine position with their legs extended straight and arms resting alongside their body. Their head appears to be slightly lifted off the ground, suggesting they might be engaging in an exercise or pose that involves minimal upper body movement.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Legs-Up-the-Wall Pose

Justification:
- The individual's posture does not involve any standing elements typical of poses like Warrior III or Tree Pose.
- There are no arm positions indicative of shoulder stand (Sarvangasana) or cobra (Bhujangasana).
- The lack of hand support under the hips rules out many forward bends such as Standing Forward Bend (Uttanasana) or Wide-Legged Forward Bend (Prasarita Padottanasana).

Given these observations, ""Legs-Up-the-Wall Pose"" seems most appropriate because it often features lying flat against a wall while keeping limbs relaxed, which closely matches the described scenario without being too specific about minor details.",25,Fish Pose,37,Legs-Up-the-Wall Pose
Fish_Pose_or_Matsyasana_/181.jpg,"Description: The individual is lying on their back with the head and upper torso lifted off the ground.

Explanation: Based on the description provided:
- The person's back is lifted off the ground.
- One hand supports the lower part of the body (likely an elbow).
- There's a noticeable arch in the spine as they lift their chest upwards while maintaining contact with the floor through both hands and feet.

These characteristics align closely with the ""Cobra Pose"" from the list of yoga poses given. In this pose, practitioners typically lie face down with arms extended behind them, lifting the upper body into an arched position using the strength of the back muscles. However, since only one arm is visible providing support here, it seems like a variation where less effort is required by that particular limb compared to traditional Cobra Pose execution.",25,Fish Pose,10,Cobra Pose
Fish_Pose_or_Matsyasana_/361.jpg,"Description: The image depicts a person performing the Camel Pose (Ustrasana) in yoga.

Their legs are bent with knees raised towards the chest, and feet appear to be resting against each other or slightly apart. Arms are positioned alongside the body, close to the torso. This position suggests a relaxed state often associated with restorative yoga poses.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Child Pose (Balasana)

This pose aligns well with the described posture of being flat on the back with arms by the sides and possibly bending forward into the child's pose if one were to transition from this relaxation stance. However, given that they are not fully in the traditional form where hands would reach out front and forehead touches the ground, it leans more toward a variation rather than an exact match for any listed classes.",25,Fish Pose,9,Child Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Reclining Cobbler Pose

The pose described closely matches the ""Reclining Cobbler Pose,"" which involves reclining on one's back with bent knees drawn towards the chest, hands placed near the hips for support, and feet flat on the floor.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Dolphin Plank Pose

Explanation: Based on the description of the image, where the person's arms are positioned under their shoulders (as opposed to directly beside them) and they maintain a strong alignment through the legs, hips, and torso, this posture closely resembles the ""Dolphin Plank"" or ""Pincha Mayurasana"" as it’s known in yoga terminology. Unlike a standard plank which uses palms for support, dolphin plank utilizes forearms, making it both more challenging and beneficial for strengthening different muscle groups including triceps, shoulders, and core.",26,Four-Limbed Staff Pose,15,Dolphin Plank Pose

Explanation:
The pose described involves extending one's legs forward while keeping them parallel, reaching for the toes or shins, and bending at the hips without touching the thighs to the floor.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bow Pose

Justification:
The description of the pose aligns closely with ""Bow Pose"" (Dhanurasana), which typically includes an arched back position similar to what's observed here. However, since there isn't direct contact between the feet or toes as usually seen in Dhanurasana, it may be more accurately described by its distinctive feature of grasping one’s own fingers, suggesting a variation that could also include elements from poses like Cobra Pose for the chest opening but lacks the full backbend characteristic of Bow Pose.

It's characterized by sitting upright with feet together and toes pointing forward, then bending at the waist to reach towards the big toe of one leg using either hands or an assistive tool like a yoga strap for support. In this case, since we see only one hand touching the foot, it could be interpreted that they might use a strap (which isn't visible but often used) instead of directly grasping the foot themselves due to flexibility limitations.",35,Heron Pose,48,Reclining Hand-to-Big-Toe Pose

Heron_Pose_or_Krounchasana_/2_91.jpg,"Description: The individual is sitting on the grass with their legs bent and feet flat on the ground. They are reaching up towards their knees, which suggests a stretch or flexibility exercise rather than a traditional yoga pose. Their back appears to be straight, indicating they might not be in an inverted position.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Analysis:
- **Leg Position**: The person has both legs extended forward, similar to the starting position of ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana), where one sits upright with legs stretched out.
- **Arm Movement**: Reaching upwards towards the knees mimics the action of balancing while lifting the torso slightly off the ground as seen in Boats Pose.
- **Body Alignment**: Although the body isn't fully lifted here, it shows a preparatory movement that could lead into this posture if continued.

Given these observations, the most appropriate match from the list provided would be ""Boat Pose,"" considering the initial setup for balance and core engagement typically associated with Navasana.",35,Heron Pose,2,Boat Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: Given the position where the person's legs are lifted off the ground in an upright manner, this closely resembles the ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana) from yoga practices. In Navasana, one typically sits with legs bent at 90 degrees, then lifts both legs parallel to the floor without bending the knees too much.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: Based on the body positioning described—arms straight out front, feet off the ground while maintaining leg lift—the most appropriate yoga pose from the given list appears to be ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana). In this classic yoga posture, one lies down initially before lifting both torso and legs simultaneously into an upright position, which aligns closely with the description provided for the image.",38,Locust Pose,2,Boat Pose
Locust_Pose_or_Salabhasana_/505.jpg,"Description: The person in the image is performing a yoga pose that involves lying on their back with legs extended straight up and arms reaching forward to hold onto the feet.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bridge Pose

Explanation:
The pose described matches the characteristics of the ""Bridge Pose"" (Setu Bandhasana) commonly practiced in yoga. In this posture, the practitioner lies flat on their back with knees bent and feet flat on the ground, lifting the hips toward the ceiling while keeping the shoulders grounded. It's similar but not identical to the pose shown here due to the extension of the legs upwards rather than bending at the knees, which might suggest a variation like ""Upward-Facing Two-Foot Staff Pose.""

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Justification:
The pose involves extending the chest upwards while maintaining contact with the ground through the palms or forearms, which aligns closely with the characteristics of the Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana).

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

The description matches closely with ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana), which involves balancing on the sit bones with knees bent at 90 degrees, feet flat on the floor, and arms reaching forward holding an imaginary rope tied around your feet.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

The pose described matches closely with ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana), which involves balancing the torso upright while sitting with bent knees and holding onto one's shins or ankles for support.

Justification for Prediction:
- The position of the legs elevated upwards closely matches the description of ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana), which involves lifting the legs parallel to the floor while maintaining balance.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: Based on the body position described, where participants have their legs lifted off the ground while maintaining contact at the heels, it closely resembles the ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana) commonly found in yoga classes.

Explanation:
The pose features a significant arch in the back, which is characteristic of Dhanurasana. This pose typically includes bending forward over extended legs while keeping the arms on the floor for support. In this case, although the hands touch the ground near rather than directly under the shoulders, it still aligns closely enough with the fundamental structure of the Bow Pose. Other options like Camel Pose would involve more of a rounded upper back without the extension seen here, whereas poses such as Cobra Pose have less depth in the backbend compared to what's depicted.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Upward Bow Pose

This prediction fits because the pose involves lifting the body off the mat while keeping the hands grounded, similar to the traditional Wheel Pose where one sits up and lifts the torso. However, due to the lying down orientation and the angle at which the person's head is positioned relative to the hips, it closely matches the description of the Upward Bow Pose when performed from a different starting point such as a supine position.",45,Plow Pose,69,Upward Bow (Wheel) Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Explanation: This description closely matches ""Camel Pose"" (Ustrasana) from the list provided. In Camel Pose, the practitioner arches their spine deeply backwards, similar to the shape described above. However, since the legs' positions differ—typically, only one leg touches the ground in Camel Pose—the specific combination of elements suggests that it might be a variation or progression towards more advanced poses like Bow Pose (Dhanurasana).

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: Based on the body positions described, where both participants have one leg raised vertically while supporting themselves from behind, it closely resembles the ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana) commonly practiced in yoga. This pose typically involves sitting upright with knees bent and feet flat on the ground, balancing on the sit bones as you lift your legs off the floor parallel to each other. However, since these individuals are not seated but instead lying down, they might be practicing variations of the basic principles found in different poses like Bridge Pose or supported versions that focus more on flexibility and core strength without traditional seat support.",45,Plow Pose,2,Boat Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Explanation: While the exact alignment of body parts may not perfectly match traditional descriptions due to variations among practitioners or modifications made during practice, this pose closely aligns with the characteristics of the Camel Pose. In a standard Camel Pose, the practitioner lies flat on their back with hands placed behind them, elbows flared outwards, and then slowly lifts the chest upwards by pressing into the thighs, bringing the pelvis closer to the throat area.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: Based on the description of the pose—where the body arches backward, legs are extended upward, and hands reach forward—the most appropriate match from the provided list of 82 classes would be ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana). In this classic asana, one typically lies down to lift both torso and legs off the ground simultaneously, creating a boat-like position. However, since the subject appears to have only lifted their upper body without supporting it with feet touching the floor or any other surface, it closely resembles a variation known as ""Cobra Pose"" (Bhujangasana) but lacks the full extension required for that specific class.

In this pose, one typically lies flat on their back, bends their knees bringing them up to hip level or higher, then lifts the pelvis upward using the glutes, engaging the core muscles for support. The arms are usually placed alongside the body or can be used for balance if needed. Given that the person's legs are fully extended and they appear to have lifted their torso off the ground slightly, it strongly suggests the execution of a variation known as the ""Full Bridge Pose,"" which requires more strength and flexibility than the standard version.",45,Plow Pose,5,Bridge Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation:
The pose described in the image closely resembles ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana) from yoga practice. In this pose, one typically lies flat on the back with arms stretched out to the sides while lifting both torso and legs off the ground simultaneously. This is similar to what we see here where they have lifted their upper bodies slightly but not as high due to being seated rather than standing.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: The described pose closely matches ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana), which involves balancing on the sit bones with legs lifted parallel to the floor in an upright position.

On the right, another individual is lying on their back against a wall with knees bent upwards at approximately 90 degrees, forming a ""V"" shape with their body. Their arms are relaxed by their sides, and they appear to be engaging in a gentle stretch that could be part of a relaxation sequence or preparation for more complex postures.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bridge Pose

Explanation: Based on the description provided:

1. **Left Image:** 
   - The position where the feet are lifted high into the air while supported by the hands suggests a variation of the ""Bridge Pose.""
   - The arching of the back indicates increased spinal flexion typical of this posture.
   - Given its complexity compared to standard Bridge Poses, it might also involve elements similar to ""Scorpion Pose,"" but without the full backbend aspect described here.

2. **Right Image:**
   - The V-shape formed between thighs and torso aligns closely with the basic form of the ""Bridge Pose."" However, since there's no visible lifting action (which would make it a true Bridge), it seems closer to preparatory stages leading into such positions rather than being one itself directly.
   
Thus, considering both images together and focusing primarily on the primary features displayed which match well within recognized yoga practice terminology, ""Bridge Pose"" remains most appropriate as it encompasses aspects seen across multiple variations shown throughout these exercises.",64,Shoulder Stand Pose,5,Bridge Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose (Navasana)

Explanation: Based on the body position described, where the legs are raised straight up into the air while lying flat on the back, this closely resembles the ""Boat Pose"" or Navasana from traditional yoga practices. In Navasana, one typically lies down with knees drawn towards the chest before extending the legs outwards as part of the progression of poses leading to more advanced variations like the one depicted here.",64,Shoulder Stand Pose,2,Boat Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bound Angle Pose

Explanation: This description closely matches the ""Bound Angle Pose"" (Baddha Konasana) in which the legs are brought together with soles touching while seated or reclining, creating an angle between the thighs. However, since this person is not sitting but rather lying down, we can infer it's likely a variation of this pose adapted for supine practice.

- The individual's torso is raised while balancing on the sitting bones.
- Both legs are bent at approximately 90 degrees near the knees, similar to how one would sit on a boat.
- Arms may be resting beside or slightly away from the body for balance, which aligns with common variations seen in Navasana practice.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation:
The pose described involves balancing while seated (though in this case it's done supine), which aligns closely with the ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana). This yoga pose typically requires balance, core strength, and focus, similar to what we observe here where the individual maintains an upright position against gravity using only upper body strength.",64,Shoulder Stand Pose,2,Boat Pose

Their feet are pointed, and the soles of the feet appear to be pressed firmly into the wall for support. This position suggests an inversion or a pose that involves balancing on the lower body while using the wall for stability.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Legs-Up-the-Wall Pose (Viparita Karani)

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

The ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana) is characterized by sitting upright with knees bent and feet flat on the ground while balancing on the sit bones. It involves engaging core muscles for stability but does not match the position seen in the image where both participants have their legs straight up against the ceiling.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: Based on the description provided, this yoga pose closely resembles ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana), which typically features an upright torso position with knees bent and both feet lifted off the ground in front of the thighs. However, since the individual has one leg extended upwards instead of being parallel to the floor as seen in traditional Boat Pose, there's a notable variation from standard practice. Despite this difference, the engagement of core muscles and focus on balance remain consistent with the essence of Navasana.",64,Shoulder Stand Pose,2,Boat Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: Based on the description of the body position—lying flat with legs lifted—and the distinctive feature of using hand support for stability, the most appropriate name from the list provided is ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana). In Navasana, one typically lies down with arms at sides or behind head to lift upper body off ground while balancing on lower abdomen muscles; however, here we see an adaptation that still fits closely within this category due to its inversion aspect.",64,Shoulder Stand Pose,2,Boat Pose

In this pose, one typically lies flat with hips open to the sides while keeping feet together at hip width, often using props like cushions or blankets for comfort.

The person's body position closely resembles that of the ""Reclining Cobbler Pose,"" which involves reclining on one's back while bringing knees towards the chest in a manner similar to sitting cross-legged but without actually doing so.

Explanation: Based on the description provided, this yoga pose closely matches the characteristics of ""Child's Pose."" In traditional practice, Balasana involves sitting back on the heels with the body folded forward onto the shins, forearms, and then head touching the ground for relaxation. Although the person has not fully seated into this relaxed state here, elements such as bending forward and having an extended spine align well with the foundational posture of Child's Pose.

In the left pose, they are bent forward at the hips with their hands and feet on the ground, forming an inverted ""V"" shape with their body. This is known as Camel Pose (Ustrasana). In the right pose, the individual is in a plank position, balancing on their wrists and toes while lifting their legs off the ground.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Explanation: Based on the description of both poses:
1. The first pose involves bending backward from the waist with extended arms and straight legs, which matches the characteristics of Camel Pose.
2. The second pose demonstrates a variation of Plank Pose where the knees are lifted to form a straight line from head to heels, fitting into the category of various plank variations or related poses like Dolphin Pose. However, given the simplicity and focus on leg lift without additional arm support, it closely resembles the basic Plank Pose more than any advanced modification listed here.",7,Cat Cow Pose,6,Camel Pose

Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/1_49.jpg,"Description: The image shows two stages of a yoga pose. In the first stage (fig 1), labeled ""Inhale,"" the person is in a kneeling position with their hands on the ground, elbows bent at approximately a 90-degree angle and close to the body. Their spine appears elongated, suggesting an inhalation posture that likely involves expanding the chest.

In the second stage (fig 2), labeled ""Exhale,"" the individual transitions into a forward bend. They lower their torso towards the floor while maintaining contact with both palms and toes. This transition indicates exhalation, which typically accompanies bending or deepening stretches in yoga practice.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Justification:
- **Body Position:** The initial upright position followed by a forward fold suggests a sequence involving spinal extension.
- **Distinctive Features:** The focus on extending the back while keeping feet flat aligns closely with Camel Pose characteristics.
- **Breath Coordination:** The labeling (""Inhale"" for expansion; ""Exhale"" for folding) supports this identification as it matches typical breath patterns during Camel Pose execution.",7,Cat Cow Pose,6,Camel Pose

On the right side of the image, the same individual is demonstrating another variation of the puppy pose where their lower back arches significantly more towards the ceiling compared to the standard Extended Puppy Pose. This deeper backbend could be referred to as a modified version of the pose or possibly leading into a transition to other advanced backbends like Camel Pose (Ustrasana).

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Explanation: Based on the body positioning—hands flat on the floor, elbows bent inward, hips lifted off the mat, and neck extended downward—the described posture closely matches that of the Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana).

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

The distinctive features that align this pose with ""Camel Pose"" include:
- The person’s body forming an arch.
- Hands firmly planted on the ground while supporting the upper body weight.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Low Lunge Pose

Explanation: Given the body's orientation—kneeling with a forward lean—and considering the focus on stretching the hamstrings and thighs while engaging core muscles, ""Low Lunge Pose"" fits well as it involves similar actions of deep bending at the hips and front thigh area. Additionally, this yoga pose often requires balancing through arm placement, which aligns with how the person’s hands seem positioned close to the ground for stability during the depicted posture.",7,Cat Cow Pose,40,Low Lunge Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Explanation: Based on the body position described, where the individual's back is significantly arched upward and they maintain balance through their forearms touching the ground, this pose closely matches ""Camel Pose"" (Ustrasana). In Ustrasana, practitioners typically lift their chest upwards by pressing into their hands placed behind them, similar to how the figure in the image appears to be doing.",7,Cat Cow Pose,6,Camel Pose
Cat_Cow_Pose_or_Marjaryasana_/2_409.jpg,"Description: The individual is in a yoga pose with the body arched backward and hands placed firmly on the mat. This posture resembles a hybrid of Camel Pose (Ustrasana) and Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana). The hips are lifted, creating an upward curve from the lower back to the upper spine.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Extended Puppy Pose

This prediction fits because:
- The person's elbows are bent and resting directly under their shoulders.
- Their chest is slightly raised off the ground while maintaining contact at the wrists or forearms for support.
- There is no significant elevation like in a full Camel Pose but more than what would be seen in a basic Cobra Pose due to the pronounced arching of the back.",7,Cat Cow Pose,20,Extended Puppy Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose (Ustrasana)

Explanation for Prediction:
- **Kneeling Position**: Both knees are planted on the floor, which matches the starting stance of many back-bending poses.
- **Forward Bend with Back Arch**: The notable feature is the pronounced arching of the spine towards the ceiling, characteristic of Ustrasana or Camel Pose.
- **Hand Placement**: Hands are positioned beside the legs rather than behind the heels, aligning more closely with traditional descriptions of Camel Pose where palms may rest on thighs but not necessarily directly behind the feet.
- **Backward Curvature**: The extreme curvature of the lower back further supports this identification, as Camel Pose emphasizes opening up through the chest and extending the spine upwards.",7,Cat Cow Pose,6,Camel Pose

This prediction aligns with the described position as it involves raising one's chest off the ground while keeping the legs elevated, which shares similarities with the Wheel Pose or Paripurna Navasana.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bound Angle Pose

Justification for Prediction:
- **Bound Angle Pose (Baddha Konasana)** involves sitting with legs extended forward in a bound angle, which closely matches the described body position.
- The individual's crossed arms and slightly arched head resemble the typical appearance of someone performing this pose while seated cross-legged but here they appear to be laying down instead of sitting upright as often seen in traditional descriptions.
- While not exactly matching due to being supine rather than seated, it shares similarities such as bringing attention inward through arm positioning and potentially offering comfort by hugging oneself tightly against gravity when done from a prone state.",13,Cow Face Pose,3,Bound Angle Pose

Their right leg is bent at the knee, bringing it towards their chest while stacking the knees as closely together as possible. The left leg extends out to the side, providing balance.

The torso is slightly turned to one side, allowing the chest to open up fully. This position helps stretch the hips and groin area. Both arms extend from the sides; the right arm reaches forward along the ground or the extended leg, creating an arc through the body, while the left arm stretches back behind them. 

The head is tilted upwards, looking over the shoulder opposite the stretched arm, promoting alignment and opening throughout the spine. Arrows point to specific instructions related to maintaining proper form:

1. Keep the chest open.
2. Ensure that the knees are stacked or as close to stacked as comfortable.

Cow_Face_Pose_or_Gomukhasana_/382.jpg,"Description: The image shows a person in two different yoga poses. In the left pose, they are seated with their legs extended forward and arms reaching behind to grasp their feet or ankles.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Wide-Legged Forward Bend

The pose on the left closely resembles the ""Wide-Legged Forward Bend,"" also known as Upavistha Konasana, which involves sitting with legs wide apart and bending forward towards them. However, due to slight variations such as grasping the feet instead of resting hands on thighs, it might be considered a modified version of this pose. 

The pose on the right could potentially fit into categories like ""Intense Side Stretch"" (Utthita Parsvakonasana) or similar side-bending postures that involve using one hand to reach around the body but without specifying exact alignment details, it's challenging to definitively categorize it among the 82 classes listed.",13,Cow Face Pose,77,Wide-Legged Forward Bend

This pose appears to focus on opening the chest and shoulders.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Seated Forward Bend (Paschimottanasana) or possibly Wide-Legged Forward Bend (Uttanasana)

Justification:
- The position of the legs suggests either a wide-legged forward bend or a seated forward bend.
- The arm stretch indicates an emphasis on upper body openness, which aligns more closely with Paschimottanasana than Uttanasana.
- Without seeing the torso fully folded over the thighs, it's challenging to definitively classify this as Paschimottanasana; however, based on the description provided, it seems closer to that posture due to the arm extension and slight backward lean.",13,Cow Face Pose,52,Seated Forward Bend
Cow_Face_Pose_or_Gomukhasana_/569.jpg,"Description: The individual is in a yoga pose that resembles the ""Camel Pose"" (Ustrasana).

Predicted Yoga Pose: Cobra Pose

Explanation: Based on the description of the pose where the person's torso is leaning back slightly, extending an arm upward, and resting another hand or forearm behind their head to support themselves, this closely matches the ""Cobra Pose"" (Bhujangasana) from yoga classes. This pose typically involves lying face down with arms extended forward for balance, but here it appears that due to the angle and posture described, they are performing a variation which could be interpreted as stretching similar muscles involved in the traditional Cobra Pose.",13,Cow Face Pose,10,Cobra Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Wide-Legged Forward Bend

Justification for Prediction:
- The pose involves sitting cross-legged as seen.
- Holding onto the foot (though not explicitly visible here) suggests an element of balancing or stretching that aligns closely with forward bends.
- The wide-leg position indicates it might resemble poses like Wide-Legged Forward Bend more than others listed which require different body orientations such as standing positions or arm placements typical of other yoga classes mentioned.",13,Cow Face Pose,77,Wide-Legged Forward Bend

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bound Angle Pose (Baddha Konasana)

Justification:
- The individual's arms placement around their torso indicates they may be preparing for or already engaged in a seated forward bend.
- ""Bound Angle Pose"" involves sitting with legs spread wide apart so that the soles of the feet touch each other while keeping the knees off the ground; it aligns closely with what can be inferred from this partial view where someone appears ready to move into such a position due to their hand placement near the waist/hip area.",13,Cow Face Pose,3,Bound Angle Pose

Justification:
- The person's posture matches that of ""Camel Pose"" (Ustrasana), where they bend backwards at the hips.
- Their hand placement near the feet aligns well with how practitioners often support themselves during this pose to maintain balance.
- The extension of the spine and overall body alignment further supports the identification as Camel Pose rather than other listed poses which either involve different directions of movement or specific limb placements not seen here.",13,Cow Face Pose,6,Camel Pose
Cow_Face_Pose_or_Gomukhasana_/453.jpg,"Description: The individual in the image is performing a yoga pose with their back arched and legs extended straight out behind them. Their arms are raised above their head, forming an inverted V shape by interlocking their fingers at the top of their forehead or crown chakra point (the highest part of the head).

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Explanation: Based on the description provided, this pose closely resembles ""Camel Pose"" (Ustrasana) from the list given. In Camel Pose, practitioners typically arch their backs deeply to touch their heels if flexible enough, which matches the posture seen in the image where the person's torso is bent backward significantly.

The described position closely matches characteristics of the ""Split Pose,"" which typically includes one leg straight out front and the other bent at an angle behind, often combined with various arm positions for balance. In this case, although not perfectly symmetrical due to the individual's orientation, it still aligns well with the general description of a split-like posture focusing on flexibility and balance.",13,Cow Face Pose,58,Split Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Half Lord of the Fishes Pose

The distinctive features such as the crossed legs, arm positions, and the overall orientation suggest that this yoga pose could be classified under ""Half Lord of the Fishes Pose,"" which often includes similar elements like extending one leg forward while keeping the torso upright and engaging core muscles for stability.",13,Cow Face Pose,30,Half Lord of the Fishes Pose

This pose involves balance, flexibility, and core strength.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Wide-Legged Forward Bend

This description aligns closely with the ""Wide-Legged Forward Bend"" (Prasarita Padottanasana), which matches the posture observed in the image where the person's legs are wide apart, and they lean forward towards their feet.",13,Cow Face Pose,77,Wide-Legged Forward Bend

Predicted Yoga Pose: Bow Pose

Justification for Prediction:
The pose features a combination of elements that match characteristics commonly associated with various yoga poses:

1. **Seated Position**: The person's base position resembles a basic sitting posture.
2. **Arms Raised Above Head**: This element aligns closely with movements often seen in transitional moves between more complex poses.
3. **Leg Positioning**: One leg being bent backward to touch the opposing thigh suggests preparation for a twist or stretch typically found in dynamic sequences like those involving ""Bow Pose"" (Dhanurasana).
4. **Back Arch**: The notable curvature of the spine as it bends backwards indicates a preparatory phase before reaching deeper into a twist or inversion common in many advanced yoga practices.

Given these observations, the most appropriate name from the provided list would be ""Bow Pose,"" which incorporates similar actions such as bending forwards and touching toes/feet, although it usually involves lying down rather than standing up as depicted here. However, considering the complexity and alignment described, it can also be interpreted as part of preparing for a variation within the bow family of poses.",13,Cow Face Pose,4,Bow Pose

Explanation:
The pose described closely matches ""Dolphin Plank Pose"" or ""Cobra Pose Variations,"" where the hands remain close to the hips rather than directly under the shoulders as seen in standard Cobra Pose.

Explanation: Given the description, the most appropriate yoga pose from the list provided would likely be ""Camel Pose"" (Ustrasana). In this traditional pose, one typically stands or sits upright and then bends forward, reaching towards the floor between the thighs without touching them directly. However, given that the person's body orientation suggests an inversion or more advanced variation, it could also potentially align with poses like ""Bound Angle Pose"" for seated inversions or other variations involving chairs if used as support. But based purely on the described posture where the upper body is arched backwards over the hips and supported by the arms resting on a surface, ""Camel Pose"" seems fitting due to its emphasis on deep backbends and similar arm positioning when using props such as blocks or bolsters.",17,Downward-Facing Dog,6,Camel Pose

Both these classes require advanced balance skills similar to what's depicted in the image.",32,Handstand Pose,20,Extended Puppy Pose

They are reaching upwards, grabbing their right ankle with both hands while keeping a straight line from head to heels. This pose involves opening up the chest and shoulders, creating an arch in the spine.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: Based on the description of the body position—knees bent, feet flat, torso lifted off the mat, arms extended upward, and legs forming a 90-degree angle—the most appropriate yoga pose name from the list provided is ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana). In this pose, the practitioner aims to balance by lifting the upper body while maintaining contact only at two points: the sitting bones and the feet.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Happy Baby Pose

Explanation: Based on the description provided, where the person's body forms an arch-like shape while gently stretching by holding their foot, this pose closely matches the ""Happy Baby"" yoga pose (Ananda Balasana). This pose involves lying down and bending the knees towards the chest to open up the hips, which aligns well with the described posture featuring leg bends and arm extension for balance and support during the stretch.",33,Happy Baby Pose,33,Happy Baby Pose
Happy_Baby_Pose_or_Ananda_Balasana_/34.jpg,"Description: The person in the image is lying on their back with legs bent at the knees and feet together. They are holding their right ankle with both hands, which indicates a stretch or twist of the spine. This pose appears to be focused on flexibility and spinal mobility.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Justification:
- **Legs Bent and Together**: The individual has their legs bent while keeping them close together.
- **Spinal Twist/Stretch**: By grasping one foot (in this case, the right ankle), it suggests an action that involves twisting or stretching the spine, typical for poses like ""Bharadvaja's Twist"" or variations thereof.
- **Back Flat on Ground**: The posture shows the torso flat against the ground without any support from arms or elbows, aligning more closely with stretches rather than balancing postures.
Given these observations, ""Boat Pose,"" known as Paripurna Navasana in Sanskrit, fits well because it often includes elements of leg bending and spinal engagement through various modifications such as adding twists or stretches using different parts of the body. However, since the description does not mention balance or core strength typically associated with traditional Boat Pose, the interpretation leans towards a simpler variation focusing purely on spinal extension and flexion.",33,Happy Baby Pose,2,Boat Pose
Happy_Baby_Pose_or_Ananda_Balasana_/316.jpg,"Description: The individual is lying on their back with legs bent at the knees and feet held together above the head. This position suggests a variation of a seated or supine pose that emphasizes flexibility in the hamstrings, hips, and shoulders.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: Based on the description provided by the image, where one's body is positioned horizontally (lying down) while holding the feet up towards the ceiling, it closely resembles the ""Boat Pose"" known as Paripurna Navasana in Sanskrit. In this traditional yoga posture, typically done sitting upright, both hands grasp the feet. However, due to the person being reclined here, we can deduce that they are performing an adaptation or modification of the original pose for ease or comfort, which still aligns with the essence of strengthening core muscles and stretching the abdomen when performed correctly.",33,Happy Baby Pose,2,Boat Pose

Explanation: Based on the description provided, this yoga pose closely resembles ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana), where typically both hands hold an ankle but it's not uncommon for variations to occur.

Explanation: Based on the body position described—cross-legged sitting with an upright posture, hands positioned as if holding imaginary objects above the knees—the pose closely resembles the traditional Seated Forward Bend (Paschimottanasana) variation known for its meditative qualities.

Predicted Yoga Pose: One-Legged Tree Pose (Vrksasana) or Half Moon Pose (Ardha Chandrasana)

The pose closely resembles a variation of Vrksasana, which typically involves balancing on one foot while extending the opposite leg outward. However, since it's not clear if both hands are touching each other as in standard Vrksasana, this might be interpreted more broadly as a creative expression within yoga practice.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: The described position closely matches the ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana), which involves balancing on the sit bones while keeping the upper body upright and parallel to the ground. However, given that this person's feet are lifted vertically rather than resting flat on the mat as typically seen in Navasana, it might be interpreted more specifically as a variation or preparation for such poses.

Explanation: While the exact pose may not be a standard named posture from the list provided, it closely resembles variations of poses that involve balancing leg extension while supporting hips or thighs for stability. Given the description, ""Bound Angle Pose"" (Baddha Konasana) is often used to open up the inner thighs and groin area but can also incorporate different positions depending on how one supports themselves during practice.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Shoulder Stand (Sarvangasana)

Justification for Prediction:
- **Legs Position:** The person's legs are straight up towards the sky, which is characteristic of a shoulder stand.
- **Body Alignment:** The alignment from head to feet appears straight, indicating an inverted position commonly seen in shoulder stands.
- **Supporting Hands:** The placement of hands under the lower back supports this identification further, as it helps stabilize the inversion typical of a shoulder stand.
- **Absence of Head Support:** Unlike some variations where individuals use props or other parts of their body to support themselves at different points along the neck, here there seems to be no additional aid, reinforcing the simplicity often associated with traditional shoulder stands.",64,Shoulder Stand Pose,53,Shoulder-Pressing Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Boat Pose

Explanation: Based on the body position described, where the legs are lifted horizontally while maintaining contact with the hands near the lower abdomen, it closely resembles the ""Boat Pose"" (Navasana) or its variations such as ""Revolved Boat Pose."" However, given that only one leg is visible and fully extended, this specific variation suggests the traditional Boats Pose rather than any of its revolved counterparts.",64,Shoulder Stand Pose,2,Boat Pose

Predicted Yoga Pose: Camel Pose

Justification:
- The backbend position suggests it could be either a variation of Urdhva Dhanurasana or another similar pose.
- Given that this is seen as an inverted version, it closely aligns with Camel Pose, which also involves bending backwards while lying on the stomach.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Low Lunge Pose

Explanation: Based on the description of the pose—feet arranged in a wide lunge position with one leg forward and both hands reaching up—the most appropriate match from the provided list is the ""Low Lunge Pose.""

Predicted Yoga Pose: Low Lunge Pose

The combination of the forward bend from the front leg, the stretch along the spine, and the extension of both arms upward strongly suggests that this is the ""Low Lunge"" (Anjaneyasana) pose. In Anjaneyasana, one typically faces away from the viewer with legs spread wide apart—one knee down and hip-width apart—while reaching up through the hands.

Predicted Yoga Pose: Extended Side Angle Pose

Explanation: Based on the body position described, where there is a pronounced lean of the torso alongside the supporting arm while maintaining a straight line from the hips to the feet, it closely matches the characteristics of the Extended Side Angle Pose (Utthita Parsvakonasana).
